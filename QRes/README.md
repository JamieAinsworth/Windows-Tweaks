QRes is a tool that allows you to switch display resolutions without the use of a GUI

Included are two bat files that when ran will change the resolution and refresh rate of the main display. 

Example:
"[root folder]\QRes\QRes.exe" /x:2560 /y:1440 /r:360

change the root to where the QRes folder is stored, change x to horizontal resoultion, y to vertical and r to resfresh rate
